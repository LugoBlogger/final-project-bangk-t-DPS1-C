# Hand Sign Classifier with MobileNet V2

## Foreword

Welcome to our preliminary project for Bangk!t final project. In this project, we want to create an app to track hand motion, but we find out it is not easy to implement. Then we start to study first how to deploy image classification. To do that, we use simple dataset (unfortunately very few in numbers) of American Sign Language. From this image classification app, we can improve our understanding on how mobile app deployment works.

To simplify further, we use pre-build Android app from (TensorFlow example)[https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/image_classification/android].
